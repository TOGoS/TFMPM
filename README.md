# TOGoS's Factorio Map Preview Manager

```util/generate-map-preview``` - generate a preview.  Information will be stored into logs/<current date in Y_m_d format>.jsonl.

## Other stuff

This is a PHPTemplateProject-based project,
which means it's got a lot of boilerplate stuff built in for doing JSON web services.
I expect that there will be a web component for visually comparing maps.
In the meantime, cruft is crufty.
